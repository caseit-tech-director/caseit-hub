        <p>
            It is our pleasure to welcome you to CaseIT 2021. Hosted in collaboration with the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University, CaseIT is the world’s premier International Undergraduate Management Information Systems Business Case Competition. CaseIT has welcomed 872 undergraduate competitors representing 47 universities from 19 different countries to compete in Vancouver since 2004. 
            <br></br>
            The CaseIT 2021 Organizing Committee is composed of top students from a multitude of faculties at Simon Fraser University. As this year brings unprecedented challenges and uncertainty, we strive to work humbly, innovatively, and collaboratively to provide yet another world-class experience to all attendees.
            <br></br>
            CaseIT has since developed from an internal competition to one of the most prestigious undergraduate MIS case competitions in the world. Upholding the ambition, tenacity,
            and insatiable curiosity of our international competitors, CaseIT’s mission is to provide an unparalleled, rigorous, and engaging competition for talented business students to
            challenge themselves and shine on an international stage. Not only will this talented cohort showcase their analytical skills and technology expertise, but they will be engaged in building meaningful global connections.
