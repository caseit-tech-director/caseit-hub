      <p>
        CaseIT is the premier international management information systems (MIS)
        business case competition hosted each year in collaboration with the
        Beedie School of Business in Vancouver, Canada. CaseIT brings together
        top undergraduate business students, distinguished faculty members,
        experienced industry professionals, and a dedicated student-run
        organizing committee to challenge conventional thinking and build global
        connections. The competition provides a rigorous platform to test
        students’ critical business case analysis capabilities and empower
        students to present with confidence in front of esteemed industry
        professionals on an international stage.

        This year, CaseIT takes place virtually over the course of five days in
        February. During this time, competitors engage in an intense week of
        competition that includes a preliminary round of two cases; a wildcard
        round; and a final presentation that showcases the top five teams’ case
        solving capabilities. In each round, students present to a panel of
        judges made up of industry experts. CaseIT aims to provide competitors
        with one of the pinnacle experiences of their undergraduate degree,
        enabling them to apply academic knowledge in a real-life context at one
        of the most prestigious MIS-themed case competitions in the world.
