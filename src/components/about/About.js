        <h4> About CaseIT </h4>
        <p>
          CaseIT is the premier international management information systems
          (MIS) business case competition hosted each year in collaboration with
          the Beedie School of Business in Vancouver, Canada. CaseIT brings
          together top undergraduate business students, distinguished faculty
          members, experienced industry professionals, and a dedicated
          student-run organizing committee to challenge conventional thinking
          and build global connections. The competition provides a rigorous
          platform to test students’ critical business case analysis
          capabilities and empower students to present with confidence in front
          of esteemed industry professionals on an international stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year, CaseIT takes place virtually over the course of five days
          in February. During this time, competitors engage in an intense week
          of competition that includes a preliminary round of two cases; a
          wildcard round; and a final presentation that showcases the top five
          teams’ case solving capabilities. In each round, students present to a
          panel of judges made up of industry experts. CaseIT aims to provide
          competitors with one of the pinnacle experiences of their
          undergraduate degree, enabling them to apply academic knowledge in a
          real-life context at one of the most prestigious MIS-themed case
          competitions in the world.
