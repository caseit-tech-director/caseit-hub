          <h3> Beedie </h3>
          <h5 className="sponsor-subheader">
            Diamond Sponsor
          </h5>
          <p>
            Established in 1954, Beedie has grown from humble B.C. roots to
            become one of the largest industrial developers and property
            managers in Canada with over 30 million square feet of industrial
            construction across British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario. Building
            on our strong legacy of extensive industrial developments, the
            company has diversified to include mixed-use, retail and residential
            developments, as well as capital investments. The wide range of
            Beedie’s first-class offerings and commitment to building for good
            has established the company as a market leader across the
            development community. With offices in Burnaby, Vancouver, Calgary,
            and Toronto, Beedie continues to expand into new markets across
            North America.
          </p>
          <p>
            The firm’s success is not measured by the size and diversity of its
            real estate portfolio, but by the longevity of the relationships we
            have established with our clients, homeowners and employees – many
            which span decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1986, Beedie has played a major role in developing some of
            Metro Vancouver’s most prominent business parks and award-winning
            state-of-the-art warehouse facilities. As such, Beedie has become a
            market leader in built-to-suit development and tilt-up construction.
            The company offers a fully integrated approach, handling every step
            of the development process in-house, from land development, design
            and construction to financing, warranty and property management.
            This unique approach allows us to meet our clients’ current and
            future building requirements while our experienced development and
            construction teams provide clients with unparalleled insight and
            advice, repeatedly leading to operational efficiencies and overall
            cost savings. A commitment to delivering value and quality, coupled
            with integrity, innovation and vision has defined the Beedie name
            since its’ inception.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the largest commercial property manager in British Columbia,
            Beedie prides itself on providing in-house property management
            services to more than 450 clients leasing more than 189 properties.
            With an ever-expanding industrial portfolio of almost 13 million
            square feet, our philosophy of providing proactive asset management
            is based on providing each of our valued clients with optimal
            service and support.

            Beedie Living, the residential division of Beedie, has expanded the
            company’s residential portfolio to become one of British Columbia’s
            fastest growing residential developers. Having brought over 2,400
            homes to the market since 2011, and over 7,000 homes currently in

            At Beedie, we foster talent, encourage innovation, and reward
            success. Since 2016, we’ve been recognized as a top employer both

            jobs are a tremendous community asset. In 2019 and 2020, Beedie has
            hired 58 permanent salaried employees and 35 site employees bringing
            its total employee count to 302 permanent full and part-time
            employees. Beedie is a valued member of the Burnaby community as it
            continues to provide employment opportunities for Burnaby residents
            and its surrounding communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Beedie, we believe in the power of our communities and the
            individuals who live in them. Our founder, Keith Beedie, instilled
            his unwavering commitment to giving back in the company that bears
            his name. Keith would say being involved in the communities where we
            live and work is not only good for business, it’s the right thing to
            do. His son and Beedie President, Ryan Beedie, echoes and strongly
            supports this same belief. Through our Built for Good social
            responsibility promise, that legacy is still our driving force today
            and can be seen through a variety of ongoing philanthropic endeavors
            that supports the people in our communities who need it most.
