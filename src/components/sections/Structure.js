          <p>
            This year, we have two unique cases for competitors to tackle. Case
            I has a 5-hour long deliberation period and is weighted at 40%. Case
            II has a 24-hour long deliberation period and is weighted at 60%.
          </p>
          <p>
            To win it all at CaseIT 2022, teams must do well in both cases as
            the winner is based on the combined Case I and Case II scores. Below
            is the advancement structure for CaseIT 2022.
