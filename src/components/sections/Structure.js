          <p>
            This year, we have two unique cases for competitors to tackle. Case
            I has an 8-hour long deliberation period and is weighted at 40%.
            Case II has a 24-hour long deliberation period and is weighted at
            60%.
          </p>
          <p>
            To win it all at CaseIT 2021, teams must do well in both cases as
            the winner is based on the combined Case I and Case II scores. Below
            is the advancement structure for CaseIT 2021.
